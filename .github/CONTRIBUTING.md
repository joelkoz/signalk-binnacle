# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Binnacle (`signalk-binnacle`).

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you agree to uphold it.

## Reporting bugs

Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates, then open a bug report with:

- A clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (Binnacle version, Signal K server version, browser, and device)
- Relevant browser console output

## Suggesting enhancements

Open a feature request issue describing the proposed feature, the use case it
serves, and any implementation ideas you have.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Follow the [Development section of the README](../README.md#development)
   for setup, build, and test commands. Lint and format use the Biome binary,
   which must be installed and on your `PATH`.
3. Run `npm run hooks` once so the git pre-commit and pre-push gates run for you.
4. Make focused commits with clear messages (see below).
5. Add tests for any new functionality and keep the existing suite green.
6. Run `npm run lint`, `npm run check`, `npm run cruise`, `npm test`, and
   `npm run build` before pushing.
7. Update documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) as needed.
8. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change.

## Code style

- All source is TypeScript and Svelte 5 (runes) under `src/`, built with Vite
  into `public/`.
- Lint and format with Biome (`npm run lint`, `npm run format`), and type-check
  with svelte-check (`npm run check`).
- Do not edit `public/`; it is generated build output.
- Keep everything SI internally (radians, meters, m/s, Kelvin) and convert
  only at the display edge.
- American English everywhere (color, behavior, center, gray).
- Default to no comments. Add one only when the WHY is non-obvious (a hidden
  constraint, a subtle invariant, or a workaround).

## Architecture rule

This repository ships exactly ONE npm package and ONE Signal K webapp. Keep the
code modular by splitting it into focused slices under `src/`. Never split the
project into multiple npm packages or a monorepo.

The layout follows Feature-Sliced Design: imports flow strictly downward,
`app -> views -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared`, every slice
exposes its public API through its `index.ts`, and cross-feature data flows
through an `entities` store, never feature to feature. The boundaries are
machine-enforced: `npm run cruise` (dependency-cruiser) fails the build on a
violation. A new feature is a new slice under `src/features/` plus its wiring
in `src/app/App.svelte`, not surgery on the core.

## Commit messages

Use conventional-commit prefixes that match the actual diff scope:

```
feat: add a tidal-current marker to the tides panel
fix: keep the anchor drag alarm latched after a reload
docs: update the offline caching instructions
test: cover the GPX import entity guard
chore: update dependencies
```
