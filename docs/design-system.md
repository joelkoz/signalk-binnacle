# Binnacle design and front-end build standard

This is the authoritative guide to how Binnacle looks, feels, and is built. Read it before designing or
building any UI. If you follow it, a new panel, menu, or feature will be indistinguishable in look and
behavior from the ones already shipped. `CLAUDE.md` holds the project's hard rules and the Signal K
integration contract; this document is the design and front-end build companion to it. When the two
overlap, neither contradicts the other: CLAUDE.md is the rule, this is the how.

## 1. What Binnacle is, and the design tiebreaker

Binnacle is a from-scratch marine chartplotter for Signal K, for the bluewater cruiser and the
liveaboard. The north star: Binnacle should be so good that people adopt Signal K specifically to use
it. Every design call is decided by that, in this order: first-run excellence on a stock server, polish
over feature count, "it just works" caching, one coherent design system, and gloved-hand marine UX.

Concretely, that means: a control a wet, cold hand can hit (44 px targets), a glance that lands on the
number not its label, a night mode that does not wreck dark adaptation, and a UI where every surface
looks like it was drawn by the same hand. A feature that looks or behaves differently from its siblings
is not done.

## 2. Design tokens are the only vocabulary

All geometry, type, color, depth, and timing come from CSS custom properties defined in
`src/styles/tokens.css`. Never hardcode a literal where a token exists. The sanctioned off-scale
exceptions are the hairline spacing tier (0.05 to 0.2 rem) and the specific fine values 0.3, 0.35, 0.4,
0.45, 0.55, and 0.6 rem; anything else is a token.

### Geometry and type (theme-independent)

- Radii: `--radius-sm` 0.3rem, `--radius-md` 0.5rem, `--radius-lg` 0.75rem, `--radius-pill` 999px.
- Spacing (4px-based): `--space-1` 0.25rem, `--space-2` 0.5rem, `--space-3` 0.75rem, `--space-4` 1rem,
  `--space-5` 1.5rem, `--space-6` 2rem.
- Type scale: `--text-xs` 0.72, `--text-sm` 0.8, `--text-base` 0.85, `--text-md` 0.9, `--text-lg` 1,
  `--text-xl` 1.15, `--text-readout` 1.25 (rem). Fonts: `--font-ui` (Inter) for chrome, `--font-mono`
  (JetBrains Mono) for numeric readouts.
- Targets: `--control-size` 2.75rem is the action tap target (buttons, pills, icon buttons);
  `--row-size` 2.5rem is the denser list-row height (menu items, layer toggles). Lists use the denser
  size, primary actions use the full size.
- `--tracking-caps` 0.06em for uppercase labels, `--disabled-opacity` 0.45, `--transition-fast`
  0.12s ease for every hover and press, `--active-bar-width` 3px for the lit-row inline-start bar.
- Z-order is a token ladder, never a raw number: `--z-overlay` 1, `--z-panel` 2, `--z-safety-strips`
  (panel + 2), `--z-menu` 5, `--z-modal` 6 (the MOB confirm is the one true modal above everything).

### Color is semantic, not literal

Use the role, never the hex. The roles: `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--accent`, `--accent-contrast`
(text on a filled accent button), `--accent-tint` and `--accent-tint-strong` (active or lit fills),
`--select` (the highlight/picked token), `--ok` (healthy dot), `--alarm` (danger), `--warning`
(caution, one step below alarm), `--border`, `--surface` (the app base), `--surface-raised` (cards,
inputs), `--surface-overlay` (floating panels). Tints are defined per theme, never as a global
`color-mix`, so night-red never drifts toward blue or green.

Depth: `--shadow-overlay` (small floating cards), `--shadow-lg` plus `--edge-light` (the largest
surfaces: the menu popout, the weather panel, the slide-overs), `--scrim` (modal backdrop).

## 3. Themes: day, dusk, night-red

Three themes, switched by `:root[data-theme]`. Day is the `:root` default (a light theme, `color-scheme:
light`). Dusk is a calm dark theme. Night-red is the discipline: pure red on true black, no blue or
green anywhere, alarms always distinguishable, the brightest pixel kept low.

You almost never write theme-specific CSS. You write tokens, and the theme carries the value. The rules
that matter when you do touch this:

- Night-red drops `--shadow-overlay`, `--shadow-lg`, and `--edge-light` to `none` (a black shadow on
  true black is invisible; the deeper red `--border` is the only surface separation). So never rely on a
  shadow alone to separate surfaces: a border must also be present.
- Green is forbidden at night: `--ok` collapses to a dim red told from `--alarm` and `--warning` by
  brightness, not hue. If you add a status color, it must survive this: distinguish by brightness, never
  by hue alone.
- Danger and caution must stay distinguishable in every theme. `--alarm` is the brighter, `--warning`
  the dimmer; that brightness gap is the contract.

## 4. The modular CSS architecture

`src/app.css` is only an ordered `@import` manifest over `src/styles/` modules, and the import order IS
the cascade order. Do not reorder it blindly: the order keeps `.is-on` (in `icon-controls.css`) able to
light the bases that precede it, and keeps `overlays.css` and `panels.css` after the bases they extend.
The order is: maplibre, tokens, base, text, buttons, forms, cards, icon-controls, scrubber, overlays,
panels, strips, a11y, vendor.

Rules:

- One concern per module. New global styling goes into the right module, never back into a monolith and
  never into a component when a global class is the right home.
- Hoist at the second copy. When the same markup or CSS appears in a second place, hoist it into a
  shared global class or a shared primitive. A third copy is a review failure.
- A component's scoped `<style>` is for layout that is genuinely local to that component. It composes
  global classes and tokens; it does not re-implement them. A panel that re-declares the row chrome, the
  card frame, the alert banner, or the field shape that a global class already provides is wrong.
- Svelte injects scoped CSS after the global sheet, so at equal specificity a component's scoped rule
  wins. When composing a global class whose state you need to win (the lit `.is-on`, a hover tint), the
  component must not set the competing property (background, border-color) in its scoped base, or it
  will defeat the shared state. See `.row-interactive` in `overlays.css` for the worked pattern,
  including the border-longhand technique for reserving a lit border.

## 5. Global utility classes (the shared vocabulary)

Reach for these before writing scoped CSS. Each lives in the named module.

- Buttons (`buttons.css`): `.btn` (the base bordered button, 44px), `.btn-primary` (filled accent),
  `.btn-danger`, `.btn-ghost`, `.btn--grow` (flex-fill), `.segmented` (a joined row of `.btn` for a
  binary or small-enum choice; the active segment carries `.is-on`).
- Icon controls (`icon-controls.css`): `.icon-btn` (square icon button), `.icon-btn--accent`,
  `.icon-btn--danger`, `.icon-pill` (a pill-shaped icon toggle), the `.panel-close` and
  `.panel-minimize` panel header controls, and the shared `.is-on` lit state (accent color, accent
  border, accent-tint fill) that lights any composing control.
- Forms (`forms.css`): `.input` (text inputs and selects, 44px, raised fill), `.range` (the live
  slider, paired with a `.num` readout), `.panel-controls` (a row of action buttons under a header).
- Text (`text.css`): `.caps-label` (the uppercase, tracked, muted SECTION heading), `.muted-note` (a
  quiet hint for empty states and inline guidance), `.alert-note` (an outline alarm banner) and its
  `.alert-note--filled` tinted variant, `.sev-danger` and `.sev-warning` (severity text coloring),
  `.panel-title` and `.panel-title--sub` (the panel header title and subtitle), `.num` (mono tabular
  numerals for any aligned readout).
- Cards (`cards.css`): `.card-frame` (the raised bordered card surface, border + radius-sm +
  surface-raised), `.saved` plus its card list (used through the SavedList primitive), `.stat-grid`
  (the label/value stat readout), the `.nav-*` family (`.nav-sort`, `.nav-list`, `.nav-row`,
  `.nav-name`, `.nav-metrics`, `.nav-metric`) for the AIS and POI two-line sortable lists.
- Overlays (`overlays.css`): `.popover-card` (the small anchored floating-card frame), `.surface-elevated`
  (the larger floating-panel frame: surface + border + radius-lg + shadow-lg + edge-light, used by the
  app-menu launcher and the weather panel), `.menu-item` (the flat control-height interactive menu row),
  `.row-interactive` (the shared control-height transparent interactive row that tints on hover and
  lights via `.is-on`; composed by the weather and route menu rows, the icon picker, and the layers
  category header), `.overlay-backdrop` (the transparent dismiss backdrop).
- Panels (`panels.css`): `.slide-over` and `.slide-over--dock-{left,right}` (the docked panel frame),
  `.panel-header`, `.panel-body`, `.panel-body--flex` (the bodyFlex column), and `.panel-footer`.
- Overlays, modals: `.modal-scrim`, `.modal-card`.

## 6. Shared UI primitives (`$shared/ui`)

Shared behavior lives here. Compose these; do not re-implement them.

- `SlideOver`: the docked panel shell. Props: `title`, `subtitle`, `ariaLabel`, `dock` (left default),
  `bodyFlex` (lay the body out as a 0.6rem gapped column; pass it on any panel whose body is a stack of
  controls), `closeLabel`, `onClose`, `onBack` (when set, a leading back arrow returns to the menu via
  the App's `backToMenu`; omit on panels opened from the chart), `headerExtra`, `footer`, and `minimize`
  (a phone collapse-to-header control). Every left-docked panel is a SlideOver.
- `AnchoredMenu`: the popover primitive (a backdrop plus a positioned surface with a scale transition
  and the dismiss-stack registration). Use it for any anchored menu (the app-menu launcher, the
  bottom-bar More menu, the opacity popover). Pass it a `surfaceClass` to position and frame the surface.
- `InlineConfirm` and `ConfirmArm`: the armed two-step confirm for destructive actions. Never a blocking
  `window.confirm`.
- `UnitField`: the labeled number-input-with-unit row for stored SI thresholds (commit on blur, snaps
  back to the effective value). Use it for a single number field with a unit; do not use it for a live
  drag (that is a `.range` slider).
- `SavedList`: the saved-item card list (used by routes, tracks, waypoints, profiles). Renders the
  `.saved` card frame and the actions row; the panel supplies the card body.
- `VisibilityToggle`: the show/hide eye toggle for a saved overlay item.
- `ShowOnChartToggle`: the full-width "Show X on chart" `.btn` toggle in a panel body that mirrors a
  layer's visibility, with the Layers eye as the source of truth.
- `UnavailableHint`: the grayed hover tooltip and screen-reader text for a capability whose provider
  is absent (used by the app menu, the status strip, and the layer rows).
- `PANEL_TRANSITION_MS`: the shared panel fly and slide duration in milliseconds, used by SlideOver
  and the weather panel so the two transitions stay in sync. JS transition timings sit outside the
  CSS token contract.
- Focus and dialog helpers: `rovingFocus`, `focusTrap`, `focusOnMount`, `onKeydownAction`, `isTabKey`,
  `dialog`, and `registerDismiss` (the Escape dismiss stack that peels the topmost surface first).
- `pickTextFile` and `readErrorMessage` for file import; `promptSaveName`, `promptRename`, and
  `defaultSaveName` for the save/rename dialogs.
- `THEMES`, `ThemeController`, `createThemeController` for the theme switch.

## 7. Panel anatomy and the field idioms

A left-docked panel is a `SlideOver` whose body is a column of sections. The conventions, learned from
every shipped panel (alarms, anchor, tracks, weather, routes, the radar controls):

- Lay the body out with `bodyFlex`, never a hand-rolled `display: flex; flex-direction: column`
  wrapper, so the 0.6rem section rhythm matches across panels.
- A section is a `<section>` with a leading `.caps-label` heading and a column of controls beneath, the
  alarm-thresholds `.group` pattern. Use a section heading to title a group; do not use `.caps-label` as
  a per-field label.
- Two label idioms, used deliberately:
  - Section headings: `.caps-label` (uppercase, tracked, muted). One per group, never per field.
  - Per-field labels: sentence case, muted, `--text-sm`, the `UnitField` `.name` style. A column of
    sentence-case field labels reads as fields; a column of uppercase labels reads as a stack of
    headings, which is noise.
- Field layout, by control mix:
  - A simple number field with a unit is `UnitField`: label on the left (flex-fill), input and unit on
    the right, at control-size height.
  - A panel that mixes wide live sliders with selects (the radar controls) puts the label on its own
    line above a full-width control, so every slider track and select box shares one left and right
    edge. For a slider, the live value sits on the label row, right-aligned, in a `.num` span. This is
    the only layout that keeps a long label and a usable-width slider from fighting for one row.
- Control patterns:
  - Live, dragged value (gain, opacity, range): `<input type="range" class="range">` with a `.num`
    readout. Never `UnitField` (that is a commit-on-blur text field).
  - Binary or tiny-enum choice: the `.segmented` group of two or more `.btn`, the active carrying
    `.is-on` and `aria-pressed`. A lone "Off" button is ambiguous; the segmented pair makes the state
    self-evident.
  - A larger enum: `<select class="input">`, full width in a label-on-top field.
  - A toggle list row (a layer, a weather overlay): `.row-interactive` with `.is-on` for the lit state.
  - A saved-item list: `SavedList` over `.card-frame` cards.
  - A destructive action: `InlineConfirm` (armed), never a blocking confirm.
  - A row of panel actions (Save, Cancel, New): `.panel-controls`.
- Display values are SI in the store; convert only at the display edge. A control whose value the
  provider already sends in display units (a radar capability range) is rendered as given, not
  re-converted.
- Empty and degraded states are first-class: a `.muted-note` for "none yet", an `.alert-note` for an
  error, a grayed unavailable row with a tooltip (via `UnavailableHint`) when a provider is absent.
  Never a blank panel.

## 8. Menus

- The app menu is the `AppMenu` launcher: a `.surface-elevated` frame holding a grid of tiles grouped by
  intent. A menu entry is a `MenuItem` (`id`, `label`, `shortLabel` for the bottom-bar pill, `icon` a
  lucide component, `group` a section heading, `pressed` for a toggle's lit state, `disabled` plus
  `disabledLabel`, `available` plus `unavailableHint`, `onSelect`). Groups today: Map, Navigate,
  Conditions, Safety, Settings. Adding a menu option is one more `MenuItem`, never a change to the menu
  component. A capability whose provider is absent sets `available: false` with an `unavailableHint`:
  the launcher and bottom bar render it grayed and non-interactive with the hint as a tooltip and
  screen-reader text, rather than dropping it from the menu. (`disabled` plus `disabledLabel` is the
  transient block for an action that is momentarily unavailable, such as a chart still loading.)
- An anchored menu (a popover hung off a control) is `AnchoredMenu`. A modal is the rare exception
  (`.modal-card` over `.modal-scrim`), reserved for the MOB confirm.
- The bottom bar renders the pinned `MenuItem`s (using `shortLabel`) plus a More overflow.

## 9. Interaction and accessibility

- 44 px (`--control-size`) for every action target; the denser `--row-size` for list rows.
- Destructive actions arm (InlineConfirm), they do not fire on a single tap.
- Escape peels the topmost surface via the shared dismiss stack (`registerDismiss`), in last-opened
  order, not a raw window listener.
- A visible label must be associated with its control: a `<label for>` for a single control, or
  `aria-labelledby` pointing at the label span for a control or a `role="group"` (the radar field
  pattern). Do not lean on a redundant `aria-label` when a visible label exists.
- A live status uses `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"`; the one assertive collision channel is
  owned by `App` and never duplicated.
- The lit state is `.is-on` (accent color, accent border, accent-tint fill). Hover tints to
  `--accent-tint`. Both come from the shared classes; do not invent a per-component lit style (the MOB
  alarm-tint is the one sanctioned exception).
- Reduced motion is honored: SlideOver and AnchoredMenu zero their transitions under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 10. Icons

- App chrome uses `@lucide/svelte` components, sized in px (`size={18}` for inline, `size={20}` for a
  control), always `aria-hidden="true"` when a text label is present. Pick an icon that reads true:
  AIS targets is a ship, the radar is the radar sweep glyph, an anchor is an anchor.
- Chart symbols are a separate system: they derive from the S-52 Presentation Library and OpenBridge,
  not from the UI icon set. That pipeline is a later spec.

## 11. Front-end coding standards

- Svelte 5 runes only: `$state`, `$derived`, `$derived.by`, `$effect`, `$props`. No Svelte 4 stores or
  idioms. A reactive dependency injected into a controller is passed as a getter `() => value`, never by
  value, or it freezes at construction (a real stale-value bug class).
- Feature-Sliced Design: imports flow strictly downward, `app -> views -> widgets -> features ->
  entities -> shared`. No same-layer slice-to-slice imports. Every slice exposes a public API via
  `index.ts` with named re-exports only, never `export *`. Cross-feature data flows through an
  `entities` store, never feature to feature. These boundaries are machine-enforced by dependency-cruiser
  and fail the build.
- Feature orchestration lives in a `create<Feature>Controller(deps)` factory in a `*.svelte.ts` module
  that owns the feature's runes and returns the handlers and getters the panels and chart read. Services
  (the Signal K client, the map, the stores) are constructed in `app/App.svelte` and passed down as
  props, not global singletons, so they are swappable in tests.
- Units: all values are SI in the store (radians, meters, m/s, Kelvin), the one exception being
  `navigation.position` (decimal degrees). Convert only at the display edge, in a separate pure module.
- Plugins are detected and degraded, never assumed: a capability backed by a Signal K plugin detects the
  provider (the `/signalk/v2/features` endpoint or a probe) and falls back to a built-in or client-side
  path when it is absent. See CLAUDE.md for the full Signal K integration contract.
- Reuse the shared non-UI helpers (`$shared/lib`, `$shared/map`, `$shared/geo`, `$shared/signalk`,
  `$entities/symbols`) before re-implementing them.

## 12. Writing and copy rules

These apply to UI text, headings, labels, comments, commits, and docs.

- No em dashes anywhere. Use a colon, a comma, or two sentences. Keep regular dashes to a minimum.
- Always use the Oxford comma in a list of three or more.
- No "&" in human-readable text; write "and". The "&" is fine only where syntax requires it (URL query
  separators, HTML entities, code operators).
- American English (color, behavior, center, gray).
- Default to no comments. Keep only non-obvious why-comments; delete comments that restate what the code
  does.
- Never describe the AI or review process in any user-facing or repo-facing writing (changelogs,
  commits, release notes, READMEs, PRs). Title and describe by what changed.

## 13. Recipe: add a new panel consistently

1. Create the feature slice under `features/<name>` with an `index.ts` public API. If it orchestrates
   runes or a service, add a `create<Name>Controller(deps)` in a `*.svelte.ts` module.
2. Build the panel as a `SlideOver` with `bodyFlex`. Title it, give it a `closeLabel`, wire `onClose`,
   and add `onBack` if it is reached from the menu.
3. Lay the body out as `<section>`s with `.caps-label` headings. Use the field idioms in section 7:
   UnitField for SI number fields, `.range` plus `.num` for live sliders, `.segmented` for binary
   choices, `select.input` for enums, `SavedList` for saved items, InlineConfirm for destructive
   actions, `.panel-controls` for the action row.
4. Use only tokens and shared classes. If you need a shape twice, hoist it into a shared class or
   primitive, not a second scoped copy.
5. Wire it in `app/App.svelte`: construct the controller and services there and pass them down, render
   the SlideOver in the panel slot, and add a gated or ungated `MenuItem` to open it.
6. Run the gate: `biome ci`, `npm run cruise`, `npm run check`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`, all
   green, before committing.
