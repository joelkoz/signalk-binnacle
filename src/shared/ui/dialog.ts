// focus trap, because these panels are non-modal: the chart stays live underneath.
//
// Open dismissables are tracked in one stack so a single Escape closes only the topmost (most
// recently opened) one. The note and weather panels can be open at the same time, and the app menu
// or an active measurement can sit over a slide-over, so without the shared stack one Escape would
// close more than one. One shared window listener serves every open entry, and an Escape that
// closes something is marked consumed via preventDefault so any foreign Escape listener can see it
// was taken.
