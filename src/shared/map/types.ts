// sections. And the track and routes bands sit ABOVE safety and traffic, so the navigator's own
// routes and tracks draw over the AIS and reference overlays (still below the pinned own-vessel and
// collision rings), and the Layers panel can lead with "My routes and tracks" above "Traffic and
// live data".
