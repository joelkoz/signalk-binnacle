# Binnacle: AI assistant operating rules

Binnacle is a from-scratch, next-generation marine chart plotter for Signal K, for the
bluewater cruiser and the liveaboard. It is NOT a port of Freeboard-SK or of the earlier
signalk-open-binnacle fork; those are conceptual references only. The project name is
Binnacle, not Open Binnacle. No legacy code is carried forward.

The north star: Binnacle should be so good that people adopt Signal K specifically to use it.
That is the tiebreaker for every call: first-run excellence on a stock server, polish over
feature count, "it just works" caching, one coherent design system, and gloved-hand marine UX
are the product itself.

This file is the source of truth for project-scoped AI assistant rules. User-global memory
does not always load reliably across worktrees or fresh clones, so rules that came at the cost
of redoing work live here.

The authoritative design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-31-binnacle-foundation-design.md`.
Read it before doing architectural work.

## Locked product and stack decisions

- Framework: Svelte 5 (runes), Vite, TypeScript. This was a deliberate clean break from the
  Angular lineage of the prior fork; do not reintroduce Angular.
- Map: MapLibre GL JS 5.x used directly, plus a thin imperative LayerManager for dynamic
  overlays. deck.gl MapboxOverlay is an optional pluggable overlay, not the base.
- Charts: a generic ChartSourceAdapter over the Signal K `/resources/charts` API, plus a
  vector base map. S-57 to vector-tile pipeline and full S-52 styling are a later spec.
- Real-time: a dedicated Web Worker hosts the Signal K WebSocket client, bridged with Comlink,
  batching deltas into frame-rate flushes on a worker timer (never requestAnimationFrame, which
  a hidden tab suspends, so data and alarms keep flowing in a backgrounded tab), feeding a
  path-keyed fine-grained runes store.
- Fonts: Inter (UI) and JetBrains Mono (numeric readouts), self-hosted.
- Icons: lucide-svelte for app chrome. Chart symbols derive from the S-52 Presentation
  Library and OpenBridge, not from a UI icon set.
- Themes: day, dusk, and night-red. Night-red is pure red on true black. No blue at night,
  alarms always distinguishable, brightest pixel low.
- App shell: hybrid chart-centric, structured so the three-mode shell (Watch, Anchor, Inhabit)
  drops in later without a rebuild.
- Layer control: per-layer toggle, opacity slider, and drag-to-reorder z-order.

## Toolchain (lint, format, build)

- Lint and format: Biome (preferred over ESLint and Prettier). Use the system binary at
  `/usr/local/bin/biome`, kept current and not added to `package.json`, so a working tree needs
  Biome installed globally to run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`. CI installs it with the
  `biomejs/setup-biome` action pinned to the same version. Config is `biome.json`. `npm run lint`
  is `biome lint .`, `npm run format` is `biome format --write .`, and CI runs `biome ci .`.
- Biome's `.svelte` support is experimental (it formats and lints the script and style blocks,
  not the control-flow template syntax). It is enabled via `html.experimentalFullSupportEnabled`.
  Re-verify it round-trips Svelte files cleanly whenever `{#if}`, `{#each}`, or other control
  flow is added (Phase 6 onward); if it ever mangles a `.svelte` file, exclude `.svelte` from
  Biome and rely on `svelte-check` for correctness. Because Biome cannot see a `{#snippet}`
  parameter used in the template body, `noUnusedFunctionParameters` is turned off for `.svelte`
  files in `biome.json`; the real backstop is `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` in
  `tsconfig.app.json`, which svelte-check enforces (it does see template usage). On Biome 2.5.0 the
  same experimental support reports false positives on valid Svelte for three new a11y rules
  (`useValidAriaValues` on dynamic ARIA bindings, `useSemanticElements` on `role="group"` toolbars,
  and `noLabelWithoutControl` on a label wrapping a child-component control), so those three are
  turned off for `.svelte` in `biome.json`; Svelte's own compiler a11y warnings, surfaced by
  svelte-check, are the Svelte-aware backstop. SVG assets are excluded from Biome (2.5.0 began
  parsing `.svg` and chokes on the XML prolog). Config uses the `linter.rules.preset` form
  (`recommended`), not the deprecated `recommended` boolean.
- Type-check: `svelte-check --tsconfig ./tsconfig.app.json` (the leaf app config, not the
  solution-style root `tsconfig.json`, which is for `tsc -b` and dependency-cruiser path
  resolution only).
- Additional libraries are allowed when they genuinely beat building in-house (user rule,
  2026-06-12), but only after EXTENSIVE research for the best one: compare the real candidates on
  maintenance activity, weekly downloads, bundle cost, API fit, license, and issue health, and
  record the comparison in the commit or PR description. Never adopt the first search hit; never
  add a dependency a few dozen lines of owned code would cover better.
- Keep every dependency at its latest compatible version. The stack is on Vite 8, TypeScript 6,
  Svelte 5, MapLibre GL JS 5.24 (used directly, not svelte-maplibre-gl), pmtiles 4, Comlink 4,
  and `@signalk/server-api` 2.

## Verify before commit and push (hard rule, mechanically enforced)

Never commit or push on a red gate. A commit message must never claim "green" before the gate
has actually run and passed. This was violated repeatedly early on, so it is now enforced by git
hooks in `.githooks/`, wired via `npm run hooks` (a non-lifecycle script, never a `prepare` hook,
per the SignalK pack-banner caveat above):

- `pre-commit` runs `biome ci .` and `npm run cruise`.
- `pre-push` runs the full chain: `biome ci`, `cruise`, `check`, `test`, and a production `build`.
  A failure blocks the push.
- `pre-push` also prints a non-blocking drift report: any uncommitted tracked changes and any
  local branch besides `main`. This exists so stray work is seen at the moment of pushing, not
  rediscovered later with unknown provenance. When it fires, commit, discard, or stash the
  changes and delete merged branches before moving on; do not let the tree drift.

Always commit and push to `main` once the gate is green after any significant change or cleanup:
do not leave significant work uncommitted in the tree. The work is not done until it is on `main`.

## Working-tree hygiene and the scratch directory

The project works directly on `main`, so the working tree should stay clean between commits.
Scratch artifacts (Playwright screenshots, throwaway debug scripts, captured logs) go in the
gitignored `tmp/` directory at the repo root, never loose at the root or inside `src/`. A stray
`*.png` at the repo root is also gitignored as a backstop. Real app and store screenshots
(`signalk.screenshots`) are not scratch: they live under `public/` or `src/` and are committed.

The working rhythm: write every file, run the gate capturing each result to a file and reading it
back (shell output on this Pi intermittently truncates, so trust the file, not a glanced line),
confirm all green, and only then commit and push. Swap covers concurrent heavy commands now, so
running several gate steps at once is fine (see "Pi memory" below). Prefer lead-driven
implementation over agent teams on this Pi; `TeamCreate` teams have dropped lane files silently
("Lock file is already being held" on spawn), which is how broken trees reached commits.

When a team IS explicitly requested for implementation, use parallel **Agent-tool subagents scoped
to disjoint files, not `TeamCreate`** (the Agent tool has no lane-lock plumbing, so it avoids that
failure; it is also what `/cleanup` uses for read-only audits). Each implementer subagent edits a
non-overlapping file set, is forbidden from running heavy commands and git, and reports back; the
lead integrates the shared and wiring files itself, runs the gate, commits in logical chunks, and
only then optionally runs review subagents (code-reviewer,
silent-failure-hunter) on the integrated diff and fixes every finding. No tmux panes or
`shutdown_request` to manage because there is no `TeamCreate`.

## Modularity is a first-class rule

Adding a later feature (weather, tides, routing, the CoPilot, anchor mode, the dashboard,
watch handoff) MUST be a self-contained module dropped in against stable interfaces, never
surgery on the core. The core never hardcodes knowledge of a specific feature.

- Layered structure (Feature-Sliced Design, adapted): imports flow strictly downward,
  `app -> views -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared`. No same-layer slice-to-slice
  imports. Cross-feature data flows through an `entities` store, never feature to feature.
- Every slice exposes a public API via `index.ts`. Named re-exports only, never `export *`.
  Nothing outside a slice imports its internal files.
- Features are self-contained slices under `features/<name>`, each exposing a public API via its
  `index.ts`. They are composed in `app/App.svelte` by static import, so adding a feature is a new
  slice plus its wiring in `App.svelte`. A `FeatureManifest`/registry that auto-collects features
  is a future option, not yet built.
- Services (the Signal K client, the map instance, the stores) are constructed in `app/App.svelte`
  and passed down as props, not global singletons, so they are swappable in tests.
- Boundaries are machine-enforced and fail the build: path aliases plus a dependency-cruiser gate
  (`no-circular`, the per-layer `entities-go-down-only`, `features-go-down-only`,
  `widgets-go-down-only`, and `views-go-down-only` rules, `shared-imports-nothing-above`, the
  cross-feature `no-cross-feature` rule, and the `no-cross-slice-shared` and `no-cross-slice-entities`
  rules that hold a `shared` or `entities` slice to reaching a sibling only through its `index`).
  dependency-cruiser is the single boundary enforcer, because Biome has no import-boundary rule
  equivalent to `eslint-plugin-boundaries`.
- The global stylesheet is modular too (user rule, keep this style for everything going forward):
  `src/app.css` is only an ordered `@import` manifest over `src/styles/` modules (tokens, base, text,
  buttons, forms, cards, icon-controls, scrubber, overlays, panels, strips, a11y, vendor), and the import order IS
  the cascade order. The utility vocabularies are split one concern per module (text helpers, the button
  system, form controls, the saved-card, stat grid, and `.nav-*` sortable two-line row list, the icon controls plus the lit `.is-on` state, the
  popover and modal scrims) and the shell into panels and strips; the order keeps `.is-on` after the
  `.btn` and `.icon-pill` bases it overrides, so do not reorder the manifest blindly. New global styling
  goes into the right module, never back into one monolith; new shared UI behavior goes through
  the `$shared/ui` primitives (SlideOver, AnchoredMenu, InlineConfirm, UnitField, ConfirmArm, SavedList,
  VisibilityToggle, the dialog dismiss stack, the rovingFocus, focusTrap, focusOnMount, and
  onKeydownAction focus actions, the isTabKey helper, the pickTextFile importer, and the promptRename
  and promptSaveName dialogs) and the
  global utility classes (the `.btn` system, `.icon-btn`, `.icon-pill`, `.popover-card`, the
  `.surface-elevated` floating-panel frame, `.modal-card`, `.menu-item`, the `.row-interactive`
  control-height interactive-row base composed by the weather, route, and layers-category rows (it
  carries the hover tint and the lit `.is-on` body at a high enough specificity to beat a scoped
  background, with border longhands so a row can reserve its lit border), `.card-frame` (the raised
  bordered card surface shared by the saved-list cards and the alarm rows), `.overlay-backdrop`,
  `.modal-scrim`, `.alert-note` and its `.alert-note--filled` tinted-banner modifier, `.muted-note`,
  `.sev-danger` and `.sev-warning`, `.segmented`, `.caps-label`, `.panel-*`, `.saved`, `.stat-grid`,
  `.num`, and the `.nav-*` family (`.nav-sort`, `.nav-list`, `.nav-row`, `.nav-name`, `.nav-metrics`,
  `.nav-metric`) shared by the AIS targets and POI search panels)
  before any panel grows a scoped duplicate. Lay a panel's body out with SlideOver's `bodyFlex` prop
  rather than a hand-rolled flex column, so the section rhythm matches across panels. When the same
  markup or CSS appears in a second place, hoist it; a third copy is a review failure.
- Reuse the shared non-UI helpers before re-implementing them: `$shared/lib` (isRecord, formatPercent,
  formatFixed and the unit formatters, the SI converters, uuidv4), `$shared/map` (featureCollection,
  emptyFeatureCollection, setSourceData, iconOffsetExpression with CENTERED_OFFSET, removeLayersAndSources,
  setLayersVisibility, createSafetyOverlay for safety-band rasters, rgbaCss), `$shared/geo`
  (latLonToLonLat and the single lat/lon-to-GeoJSON-order crossing, the Bbox4 bounding-box tuple,
  quantizeLatLonKey for a position-keyed reactive cell, VIEWPORT_FETCH_PAD_FRACTION), `$shared/signalk` resource.ts (jsonOr, sendJson, fetchKeyedResource), and `$entities/symbols`
  (createOverlayIconResolver, the provided-symbol overlay glue). An overlay that hand-rolls a
  `getSource(...) as { setData }` cast or a `{ type: 'FeatureCollection', features }` literal should use
  setSourceData and featureCollection instead.
- Feature orchestration that the composition root used to hold inline is extracted into per-slice
  controllers: a `create<Feature>Controller(deps)` factory in a `*.svelte.ts` module that owns the
  feature's runes (state, derived, effects) and returns the handlers and getters the panels and chart
  read, services injected as arguments. A reactive dependency that changes over the session (the auth
  token, a feature-detection flag, even a stable store whose `.svelte.ts` identity must stay reactive in
  a `$derived`) is injected as a GETTER `() => value`, never by value: capturing a value at construction
  freezes the initial one, which is a real stale-value bug (a stale-token regression came from exactly
  this). `createMobController`, `createAnchorController`, and `createMarineRadarController` (the first to
  own a Web Worker, the radar spokes stream) are the existing ones; the route, stream,
  notifications, waypoints, tracks, and user-charts controllers and the `views/` PlotterView extraction
  (the build already wires a `$views` layer and a `views-go-down-only` rule, but `src/views/` is still
  empty) are the documented next steps for shrinking `App.svelte`.

This is a hard rule. Architectural feedback that came at the cost of redoing significant work
must not be repeatable.

## Signal K conformance: 100% compliance, always

- The foundation ships as a Signal K webapp: keywords `signalk-webapp` and
  `signalk-category-chart-plotters`, a `signalk` manifest with `appIcon`, `displayName`, and
  `screenshots`, the build emitted into the served directory, and `files` shipping it. No
  server plugin is required for the foundation.
- README image paths must resolve in the Signal K admin UI README view, which resolves relative
  image paths against the package root (the shipped npm tarball). Binnacle ships only `public/`
  (the Vite build output), not `static/` (the Vite `publicDir` source), so a README image
  reference must never point at `static/`: it 404s in the admin UI even though it renders on
  GitHub, where `static/screenshots/` is git-tracked. For the webapp the App Store screenshot
  carousel is driven entirely by `signalk.screenshots` (paths resolved against the served webapp
  root `public/`, populated from `static/screenshots/` at build), so Binnacle does not duplicate
  screenshots in the README the way the sibling plugins do (they ship `assets/` at the package
  root and reference `assets/screenshots/` in both the README and `signalk.screenshots`). Keep
  `signalk.screenshots` as is; it is correct and working.
- Consume the v1 streaming WebSocket. Connect with `subscribe=none` and issue explicit
  subscriptions: own vessel at high rate (`policy: instant`, heading near 200 ms, others near
  1000 ms), and AIS at a controlled rate (`vessels.*`, `policy: fixed`, period near 5000 ms,
  rendered paths only). Read `self` from `hello` and filter self out of `vessels.*`.
- All values are SI in the store (radians, meters, m/s, Kelvin). The one exception is
  `navigation.position`, which is decimal degrees. Convert only at the display edge in a
  separate pure module.
- CPA and TCPA are not computed by the server core. Read `navigation.closestApproach` when a
  provider populates it, degrade gracefully when absent.
- Charts: discover at `GET /signalk/v2/api/resources/charts` (fall back to v1), branch on
  chart `type`, honor `bounds` and zoom limits. Layering order, visibility, and opacity are
  Binnacle's job.
- Course data (the v2 Course API) DOES stream over the v1 WebSocket as deltas: the server emits
  `navigation.course.*` and `navigation.course.calcValues.*` to delta-stream subscribers. But because
  those deltas carry the `SKVersion.v2` flag, they are NOT in the v1 full data model, so under
  `subscribe=none` the server sends no cached value until the next change. The pattern is therefore
  hydrate the snapshot via a v2 REST GET (`GET /signalk/v2/api/vessels/self/navigation/
  course` and `/calcValues`) on every connect and reconnect (so an active course survives a page
  reload and a course started or cleared from another station is picked up), then keep it live from
  the stream. Course
  MUTATIONS (activate a route, advance, clear) are v2 REST PUT and DELETE; the stream is read-only for
  course. The course state machine is built into the server core (present on any 2.x server); the
  derived `calcValues` (XTE, VMG, DTW, BTW, ETA) come from a separate course-provider plugin that
  ships by default but can be absent, so compute them client-side as a fallback (the
  `navigation.closestApproach` degrade pattern). Autopilot (v2) is still a later spec.
- Bundle the app's own assets locally (fonts, icons, worker): no CDN for code. The MAP base is
  the deliberate exception: it is an online vector tile source (OpenFreeMap), because shipping a
  world basemap inline is not feasible. Offline operation is achieved by CACHING that source (a
  service-worker runtime cache plus an optional pre-downloaded PMTiles region), not by removing
  it. Do not replace the base map with a flat inline style to satisfy "offline": that yields a
  blank map. Verify reachability before assuming a host is unreachable; OpenFreeMap resolves and
  returns 200 from the boat network.
- The offline/PWA caching (vite-plugin-pwa service worker) only activates in a SECURE CONTEXT:
  HTTPS or http://localhost. The Signal K server serves Binnacle over plain http on the LAN by
  default, where the browser disables the entire serviceWorker and CacheStorage APIs, so offline
  caching is inert. The app must DEGRADE CLEANLY there (registerSW no-ops, OnlineStatus falls back
  to navigator.onLine, zero errors), which it does. To activate offline, enable SSL in the Signal K
  server (Server > Settings > SSL). Do not chase "the service worker is not registering" as a code
  bug without first checking `window.isSecureContext`.
- A SECURE CONTEXT alone is NOT enough: the browser must also TRUST the server's certificate. A
  self-signed certificate (including one the signalk-ssl plugin generates, issued by a local
  "SignalK Local CA") is not trusted by default, and browsers refuse to register a service worker
  from an origin whose certificate they do not trust, even after the user clicks through the page's
  certificate warning. The symptom is `onRegisterError` firing with a SecurityError whose message is
  "An SSL certificate error occurred when fetching the script", and offline caching staying off while
  the page itself loads. The fix is environmental, not code: install the certificate (or its CA root)
  into the browser or OS trust store and mark it trusted, then reload. register.ts detects this case
  and logs an actionable info line rather than an alarming warning. Over plain http the serviceWorker
  API is absent so registerSW no-ops; over https with an untrusted cert the API is present so
  registration is attempted and fails on the cert, which is a different path from the plain-http one.
- Never import `@signalk/server-api` in browser or worker code, not even as a type-only import.
  Its entry barrel re-exports `FullSignalK`, which extends Node's `EventEmitter`; bundled into the
  worker with `events` externalized, the base class is `undefined` and the worker dies at load with
  "Class extends value undefined". Mirror the few wire types the client needs in
  `src/shared/signalk/types.ts` instead. The "events externalized for browser" build warning is the
  tell. The package may be a dev-only dependency for server-side code, but the foundation has none.
- Guard every WebSocket `send` on `readyState === WebSocket.OPEN`. The first subscriptions can be
  issued while the socket is still CONNECTING; dropping the send is safe because the subscription
  registry resubscribes everything on open.
- Server APIs over local-only storage, always (user rule): when a capability has a Signal K API
  (resources, course, notifications, applicationData), Binnacle integrates with it even when that
  requires read-write authorization rather than read-only. Local storage is the graceful degrade
  for older servers or missing auth, never the primary design. The access-request UX should tell
  the admin that Binnacle needs read-write approval (routes, waypoints, tracks, course, alarms,
  profiles all write).
- Every release must hold 100% Signal K compliance, and project files must be written per the
  Signal K spec to achieve it.

## Leverage mature plugins before building features

Binnacle does not need to build every capability itself. When a mature Signal K plugin already
produces the data (alarms, anchor watch, course calcValues, weather providers, symbols, history),
Binnacle's job is to CONSUME and surface it well, with a graceful client-side degrade when the
plugin is absent (the navigation.closestApproach pattern). Build a feature in-app only when no
maintained plugin covers it or when it is core chart-plotter interaction (rendering, editing,
touch UX). Evaluate plugin maturity before depending on one: published on npm, active within the
last year, and a stable API surface.

## Plugin assumptions, caching, and coherence (user rules, 2026-06-12)

- NEVER assume a plugin is installed just because the owner's boat server has it. Other users
  have a STOCK signalk-server (bundled plugins only: the built-in resources-provider and
  course-provider class of things). Every plugin integration detects (the /signalk/v2/features
  endpoint or a probe) and degrades gracefully to a built-in or client-side path. Where the
  upstream API is still a proposal (the Anchor API) or pre-1.0 (symbol-manager), build against
  the current shape anyway; the weekly Signal K watch routine flags changes and the code gets
  updated then.
- Caching is a first-class product goal: the gold standard is "it just works" with nothing extra
  to install, including when charts and tiles are served by another plugin. Repeat visits and
  offline-degraded operation must be seamless for every tile and data source Binnacle renders
  (base map, plugin-served charts, weather, tides, notes), within sensible quotas and expiry.
- One coherent design system, not disjointed widgets: every new surface uses the shared tokens
  (src/styles/), the shared UI primitives ($shared/ui), the established interaction patterns
  (SlideOver, InlineConfirm, armed confirms, the dismiss stack, 44px targets), and the same API
  conventions (detect-and-degrade clients in the slice, SI store, display-edge conversion). A
  feature that looks or behaves differently from its siblings is not done.

## Release policy: patches only, minor bumps are the owner's call (user rule, 2026-06-12, until revoked)

Binnacle is in beta and the owner is not concerned about breaking changes yet. Every release is
a PATCH against the current minor (0.6.1, 0.6.2, ...) until the owner explicitly says otherwise,
regardless of how large the changes are or whether they remove features. Do not bump the minor
or major on semver instinct; the version line is the owner's call (the owner called 0.6.0
explicitly on 2026-06-12). The pre-push release checklist in the global rules still applies in
full to every release.

## Build policy (every major step)

- Agent team: each major step may use an agent team of up to 6 expert agents, with at least one
  Signal K expert on steps that touch the integration. Give each a distinct, non-overlapping
  lens to avoid file conflicts.
- Cleanup gate: each major step finishes with the `/cleanup` skill.
- Fix everything: fix every finding from review, cleanup, linters, and human review, including
  low and nit. The only acceptable skip is factually refuted or by-design after honest
  scrutiny, with a one-line reason.
- Verification: after fixing, run type-check, tests, lint, and build, and confirm green before
  claiming a step done.
- Each numbered step in the spec's build order is a major step under this policy.

## Pi memory: swap covers concurrent heavy commands

This runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB RAM, 4 cores) with 9 GB of swap configured, so concurrent
heavy verification commands (type-check, lint, test, build) no longer OOM-kill the session: the
earlier one-heavy-command-at-a-time restriction is lifted. Running several at once is fine when it
saves wall-clock; expect swap to slow each one under memory pressure, so do not fan out so wide
that thrashing costs more than it saves. `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"` is no longer
required, though it remains a harmless backstop on a memory-heavy run.

## Style rules (override defaults)

- American English everywhere (color, behavior, center, gray), not British. Code, docs,
  commits, comments, and any text passed to subagents.
- No em dashes anywhere. Use a colon, a comma, or two sentences.
- Always use the Oxford (serial) comma in lists of three or more.
- No "&" in human-readable text (UI labels, headings, prose, comments); always write "and". The
  "&" is fine only where syntax requires it: URL query separators, HTML entities, code operators,
  and TypeScript intersection types.
- Default to no comments. Keep only non-obvious why comments. Delete what comments.
- These apply to text I write and to instructions passed to subagents; brief them on the same
  rules so their output does not reintroduce violations.

## Workflow

- Brainstorming artifacts live in `.superpowers/brainstorm/`, gitignored.
- Design specs live in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and build plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
  These are local-only working notes: `docs/superpowers/` is gitignored and is NOT committed to the
  repo. Each differentiator gets its own brainstorm, spec, and plan: active-safety CoPilot, weather
  and routing, anchor intelligence, the liveaboard dashboard, and multi-station watch handoff. The
  offline and PWA pipeline is the spec immediately after the foundation.
